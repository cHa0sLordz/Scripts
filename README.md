# Descriptions

(of the different Scripts in this repository)

## No liability what so ever ##

### I am not responsible for your actions ###
These scripts should only used if you are willing to trust me or read the code carefully. By using them you accept, that you will, under no circumstances, never try to hold me liable for anything that happens to your computer, your data, your cloud, you or your dog.
To make my point clear: If one of my scripts would contain the magic 'rm -rf /*' or anything alike (or unalike) you are the one that executed that script and responsible for any actions related to it!

### Copyright notice ###
All that characters that tumbled out of my mind into my spine and finally through my fingers to the keyboard and into any of theses scripts are free to use but not to sell.
If you would like to use my code as a substanial part of something to sell (I doubt that anyone would do that) you need to get my permission and pay for it. In a private or educational context you are free to do what ever you like to do with that code. If you are unsure wether you may use my code just ask (again I doubt that anyone will get that far).

### Status ###
My scripts are working (or worked) for me. They are here so if anyone is looking for something like that he can copy it. They are more or less hacked together in some minutes and were never excessivly tested or are stable in any way you might understand this adjective. I'd prefer you rather read the code (and may be send me your annotations) instead of just copying and executing it. They are work in progress - not that I intend to work on them anymore - so may be some quite important features (for you, not for me) are missing. Feel free to add them (and be kind and send your changes back to me).
